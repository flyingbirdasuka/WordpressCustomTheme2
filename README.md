This WordPress custom theme has been redesigned to make it user friendly. 

It is a multilingual site in English and Japanese. You can easily switch by clicking the buttons on the header. 

Since it is also important for this customer to show the latest blog post each time when the newest post is added, then these will appear on the front page and not only on the blog page.

To make it easy to read all the information on the front page, multiple pages are placed on the front page and this makes it easier to edit in the backend.
